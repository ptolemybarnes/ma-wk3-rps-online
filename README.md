## Synopsis
*The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following features:

the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
the marketeer can choose one option
the game will choose a random option
a winner will be declared*

## Preamble
I wanted to approach this project with the concept of Minimum Viable Product in mind. What I realised through discussions with other students is that the MVP concept doesn't work very well when you try to plan out the sequence (skateboard --> scooter --> etc.) in advance. For this challenge, therefore, I will try to forego making decisions about what future iterations will look like.
**Skateboard:** Web page where player can choose rock, scissor, or paper.
