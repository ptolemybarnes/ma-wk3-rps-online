Rock, Scissor, Paper.
=======================
by Ptolemy Barnes. 

## Synopsis
The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following features:

- The marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- The marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- The marketeer can choose one option
- The game will choose a random option
- A winner will be declared

## Preamble
I wanted to approach this project with the concept of Minimum Viable Product in mind. What I realised through discussions with other students is that the MVP concept doesn't work very well when you try to plan out the sequence (skateboard --> scooter --> etc.) in advance. For this challenge, therefore, I will try to forego making decisions about what future iterations will look like.

**Skateboard:** Web page where player can choose rock, scissor, or paper.
